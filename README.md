### Problem Overview

#### Sector/Vertical Introduction
The wedding industry in India is a booming sector worth billions, deeply rooted in tradition yet increasingly influenced by technology. Historically, wedding invitations have been crafted using elaborate designs on paper, a process that can be both costly and environmentally taxing. As millennials and Gen-Zers take the lead in wedding planning, their preference for quick, personalized, and accessible solutions is reshaping how invitations are made and distributed. 

While many wedding-related services—including venue booking, catering, and photography—have embraced digital tools, the invitation aspect has lagged. Digital wedding cards offer a strategic advantage by reducing costs associated with printing and postage while promoting environmentally friendly practices. However, despite the growing demand for such services, few platforms offer extensive customization options coupled with multi-language support, particularly in a country as linguistically diverse as India.

#### Market Coverage
The rise of online wedding planning tools indicates a substantial market opportunity for a digital wedding card generator. With over 1.3 billion people in India and more than 22 officially recognized languages, a responsive solution catering to various linguistic preferences can tap into a wide user base. 
The increasing adoption of smartphones and internet access further supports this market potential, opening up avenues for couples seeking modern solutions to ancient traditions.

#### Pain Points
Several issues persist in the current landscape of digital wedding invitations:
- **Limited Customization**: Available templates often lack creativity and personalization.
- **Language Barriers**: Most applications do not provide support for regional languages, alienating a significant portion of users.
- **Usability**: Complexity in existing tools can dissuade individuals who are not tech-savvy.
- **Cost**: High fees on some platforms can be a deterrent for budget-conscious couples.

#### App Prospects
The Instant Digital Wedding Card Generator has the potential to fill these gaps by simplifying the invitation creation process, ensuring quality translations in various regional languages, and offering competitive pricing. By addressing these challenges head-on, the application can position itself as a go-to resource for couples looking to modernize their wedding invitation experience.

### App Engineering 

#### Prospective Tech Stack
The application will harness technologies such as:
- **Frontend**: Built with React.js to create a dynamic user interface.
- **Backend**: Utilizing Node.js and Express for handling user requests and managing the application logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexibility and scalability in data management.

#### Frontend
The user interface will be designed with user experience in mind, illustrated in Excalidraw. Key pages will include:
- **Home Page**: Overview of features and language options.
- **Template Selection Page**: Display of templates categorized by theme and language.
- **Editing Page**: A user-friendly canvas where couples can customize their invitation with text, images, and colors.

#### Backend
The backend will handle functionalities such as user registration, template sorting based on user preferences, and implement fraud detection measures to ensure secure transactions.

#### Database Handling
Data types managed will include user profiles, invitation details, and RSVP information. The proposed database schema consists of:
- **Users**: { userId, name, email, languagePreference }
- **Templates**: { templateId, title, languagesSupported, designData }
- **RSVPs**: { rsvpId, guestId, invitationId, response }

Possible database solutions include MongoDB Atlas or Firebase for a managed cloud database.
