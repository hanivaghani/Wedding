- *Real-Time Preview*: Users can see how their card will look on different devices instantly, ensuring perfection before finalizing.
- *Instant Sharing*: Seamless sharing via WhatsApp, email, and social media platforms. For example, couples can directly send their invitations to guest groups without any additional steps.
- *Practical Applications*:
   - A couple from Tamil Nadu creates a vibrant digital invitation in Tamil, matching their traditional wedding theme.
   - A busy professional in Mumbai generates a modern minimalist invitation in Hindi within minutes and shares it instantly with family and friends.
